Comments: Due to time constraints and specially because the assignment was given during a busy week I was able to get started on it the night before and so I wasn't able to add the filtering or a modal to display the details for each record. I was planning to use bootstrap to achieve this; Had I been given the assignment with a little more time, for example over the weekend, I believe I should've been able to complete functionality and added extra features again because the two frameworks (Angular & React) have various similarities.
